## **Overview**
Employee attrition is a critical issue for organizations, impacting productivity and costs. This project leverages data science techniques to analyze employee-related factors contributing to attrition, enabling data-driven decision-making.

The analysis includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.
- Insights into key factors influencing attrition, such as age, department, and work-life balance.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains information about employees, including:
- Demographics (e.g., age, gender, education).
- Job-related factors (e.g., department, job level, business travel).
- Performance metrics (e.g., years at company, training times).
- Attrition status (Yes/No).

### Sample Columns:
| Column Name             | Description                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Age                    | Employee's age                      |
| Attrition              | Whether the employee left (Yes/No)  |
| Department             | Department of the employee          |
| TotalWorkingYears      | Total years of work experience      |
| WorkLifeBalance        | Rating of work-life balance         |

## **Key Features**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing attrition trends across various demographics.
   - Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships.

2. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Machine learning algorithms like Random Forest for classification.
   - Handling imbalanced datasets using SMOTE.

3. **Insights Generation:**
   - Identifying key contributors to attrition.
   - Visual comparisons of attrition rates across departments, genders, etc.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for model improvement.

## **Visualizations and Insights**
### Example Visualizations:
1. **Attrition by Age:**
   ![Attrition vs Age](https://github.com/saikat912/Hr-attrition-Prediction-/blob/c438c216dc41758fd5b74c561104827b1a13977a/download.png):**
   ![Attrition vs Department](images/attritionCorrelation Heatmap:**
   ![Correlation Heatmap](images/correlation_heatalizations help identify patterns such as higher attrition rates in specific age groups or departments.

## **Modeling and Evaluation**
### Algorithms Used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV

### Model Evaluation Metrics:
| Metric            | Train Set | Test Set |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| Accuracy          | 95%       | 89%      |
| Precision         | 92%       | 87%      |
| Recall            | 90%       | 85%      |

The model effectively predicts employee attrition while maintaining a balance between precision and recall.
